Everyone buys bargains. Some people just buy $100,000 things for only $10,000. That’s where we want to live: high prices, but a steal for the value (like hopefully this book so far).

I have always lived by the mantra, “Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction.” This means I generate demand first. Then, with my offer, I get them to say yes. Once I have people saying yes, then, and only then, will I add friction in my marketing, or decide to offer less for the same price.

For the purposes of keeping creativity high (divergent thinking), think about anything you could possibly do. Think of all the things that might enhance the value of your offer. So much so that they would be stupid to say no. What could you do that someone would immediately say, “All that? Seriously? Yes, I'm in.” Doing this exercise will make your job of selling So. Much. Easier.

Easier. Even if you come up with something you’re not actually willing to do, it’s okay. The goal here is to push your limits and jog your brain into thinking of a different version of the solution you’d normally default to. This is where you get to flex your entrepreneurial creativity. Reminder: You only need to do this once. Literally one time for a product that may last years. This is high-value, high-leverage work. You ultimately get paid for thinking. You got this. This should be fun. Go ahead and list out all your possibilities now. Then I’ll take you through my example. I’ll just use the buying food problem from earlier as an example.

But, if I told you I have it set so that every week the page only allows twenty new people to download it, you’d be far more likely to go see if you can grab it. And even more so if when you try it, you see that it has already run out for the week. Result? You join a list that notifies you the next time twenty more checklists become available for download. What happens next? When you get that notification, you’ll hit the link on your phone and go to the page because you don’t want to miss out again. By employing scarcity, we make what would otherwise be a “neat free download” into a desirable thing not everyone has access to. You also, by extension, would be far more likely to consume it when you do get your hands on it . . . all because of how we controlled supply. Cool, right?

The biggest sales on a week long campaign or launch happen in the last 4 hours of the last day (up to 50-60%). That means that the last 3% of the time allotted creates 50-60% of the sales...that’s completely illogical, but also unmistakably human.

Pro Tip: Add Bonuses Instead of Discounting Whenever Possible on Core Offers Whenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness.

The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. Psychologically as you continue to add offers, it continues to expand the price to value discrepancy. It also, subconsciously communicates that the core offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than the bonuses right?

On the maturity continuum, dependence is the paradigm of you—you take care of me; you come through for me; you didn’t come through; I blame you for the results. Independence is the paradigm of I—I can do it; I am responsible; I am self-reliant; I can choose. Interdependence is the paradigm of we—we can do it; we can cooperate; we can combine our talents and abilities and create something greater together. Dependent people need others to get what they want. Independent people can get what they want through their own effort. Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.

There are organizations that talk a lot about the customer and then completely neglect the people that deal with the customer—the employees. The PC principle is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to treat your best customers. You can buy a person’s hand, but you can’t buy his heart. His heart is where his enthusiasm, his loyalty is. You can buy his back, but you can’t buy his brain. That’s where his creativity is, his ingenuity, his resourcefulness.

The 7 Habits are an Inside-Out Approach, you see. We have to win the Private Victory (Habits 1, 2, and 3) before we can win the Public Victory (Habits 4, 5, and 6). If, for example, you have a bad relationship with your boss, instead of trying to Think Win-Win with her, you first need to examine yourself and identify what you may be doing wrong. Maybe you have bad motives or a hidden agenda. Anytime I have a relationship problem, my experience is that four out of five times, it’s me, not them, and the key to fixing the problem is getting myself right first. It’s inside out. Private Victories always precede Public Victories.

Habit 3: Put First Things Last Procrastinate. Do the urgent things first, like answering every ring, bling, and beep that comes your way. You’ll get to the important stuff later. Don’t worry about strengthening your relationships; they’ll always be there. And why exercise? You still have your health. Just make sure you spend sufficient time each day watching YouTube.

Environmental determinism basically says your boss is doing it to you—or your spouse, or that bratty teenager, or your economic situation, or national policies. Someone or something in your environment is responsible for your situation.

There are actually three social maps—three theories of determinism widely accepted, independently or in combination, to explain the nature of man. Genetic determinism basically says your grandparents did it to you. That’s why you have such a temper. Your grandparents had short tempers and it’s in your DNA. It just goes through the generations and you inherited it. In addition, you’re Irish, and that’s the nature of Irish people. Psychic determinism basically says your parents did it to you. Your upbringing, your childhood experience essentially laid out your personal tendencies and your character structure. That’s why you’re afraid to be in front of a group. It’s the way your parents brought you up. You feel terribly guilty if you make a mistake because you “remember” deep inside the emotional scripting when you were very vulnerable and tender and dependent. You “remember” the emotional punishment, the rejection, the comparison with somebody else when you didn’t perform as well as expected.

Between what happened to him, or the stimulus, and his response to it, was his freedom or power to choose that response. In the midst of his experiences, Frankl would project himself into different circumstances, such as lecturing to his students after his release from the death camps. He would describe himself in the classroom, in his mind’s eye, and give his students the lessons he was learning during his very torture.

In making such a choice, we become reactive. Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn’t, it affects their attitude and their performance.

For those filled with regret, perhaps the most needful exercise of proactivity is to realize that past mistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concern. We can’t recall them, we can’t undo them, we can’t control the consequences that came as a result.

After all that’s been said and written, being proactive comes down to two things. First, take responsibility for your life; and second, take initiative. It’s that simple. Be an agent, not a victim. Don’t wait for life to happen to you; happen to it. Be the driver of your life, not just a passenger. Live out of your imagination, not your past.

My friend Rolfe Kerr has expressed his personal creed in this way: Succeed at home first. Seek and merit divine help. Never compromise with honesty. Remember the people involved. Hear both sides before judging. Obtain counsel of others. Defend those who are absent. Be sincere yet decisive. Develop one new proficiency a year. Plan tomorrow’s work today. Hustle while you wait. Maintain a positive attitude. Keep a sense of humor. Be orderly in person and in work. Do not fear mistakes—fear only the absence of creative, constructive, and corrective responses to those mistakes. Facilitate the success of subordinates. Listen twice as much as you speak. Concentrate all abilities and efforts on the task at hand, not worrying about the next job or promotion.

If our sense of emotional worth comes primarily from our marriage, then we become highly dependent upon that relationship. We become vulnerable to the moods and feelings, the behavior and treatment of our spouse, or to any external event that may impinge on the relationship—a new child, in-laws, economic setbacks, social successes, and so forth.

Sometimes there are apparently noble reasons given for making money, such as the desire to take care of one’s family. And these things are important. But to focus on moneymaking as a center will bring about its own undoing.

Too many vacations that last too long, too many movies, too much TV, too much video game playing—too much undisciplined leisure time in which a person continually takes the course of least resistance gradually wastes a life. It ensures that a person’s capacities stay dormant, that talents remain undeveloped, that the mind and spirit become lethargic, and that the heart is unfulfilled.

Many “older” children go through life either secretly or openly hating their parents. They blame them for past abuses, neglect, or favoritism and they center their adult life on that hatred, living out the reactive, justifying script that accompanies it.

Perhaps the most common center today is the self. The most obvious form is selfishness, which violates the values of most people. But if we look closely at many of the popular approaches to growth and self-fulfillment, we often find self-centering at their core.

As a person fluctuates from one center to another, the resulting relativism is like roller coasting through life. One moment you’re high, the next moment you’re low, making efforts to compensate for one weakness by borrowing strength from another weakness. There is no consistent sense of direction, no persistent wisdom, no steady power supply or sense of personal, intrinsic worth and identity.

Third, what you choose to do contributes to your ultimate values in life. Staying at work to get the edge on someone at the office is an entirely different evening in your life from staying because you value your boss’s effectiveness and you genuinely want to contribute to the company’s welfare.

I can use my right brain power of visualization to write an “affirmation” that will help me become more congruent with my deeper values in my daily life. A good affirmation has five basic ingredients: it’s personal, it’s positive, it’s present tense, it’s visual, and it’s emotional. So I might write something like this: “It is deeply satisfying (emotional) that I (personal) respond (present tense) with wisdom, love, firmness, and self-control (positive) when my children misbehave.” Then I can visualize it. I can spend a few minutes each day and totally relax my mind and body. I can think about situations in which my children might misbehave. I can visualize them in rich detail. I can feel the texture of the chair I might be sitting on, the floor under my feet, the sweater I’m wearing. I can see the dress my daughter has on, the expression on her face. The more clearly and vividly I can imagine the detail, the more deeply I will experience it, the less I will see it as a spectator.

You can do it in every area of your life. Before a performance, a sales presentation, a difficult confrontation, or the daily challenge of meeting a goal, see it clearly, vividly, relentlessly, over and over again. Create an internal “comfort zone.” Then, when you get into the situation, it isn’t foreign. It doesn’t scare you.

Roles and goals give structure and organized direction to your personal mission. If you don’t yet have a personal mission statement, it’s a good place to begin. Just identifying the various areas of your life and the two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each area to move ahead gives you an overall perspective of your life and a sense of direction.

Example: Imagine we help homeowners sell their homes. That is a broad solution. But what about the steps before selling a home? Owners want to know what their house is worth. They want to know how to increase its value. They need pictures. They need it cleaned. They need landscaping. They need minor things fixed. They need moving services. They may need staging. Etc. These are all narrow problems–great for lead magnets. We pick one of the narrow problems and solve it for free. And although it helps, it makes their other problem more obvious–they still have to sell their home. But now we’ve earned their trust. So we can charge to solve the remaining problems with our core offer and help them achieve their broader goal.

After people show interest, make your offer easy to say yes to. I like to start with the easiest offer enhancer in the world - FREE: And don’t try to look advanced if you’re not. People aren’t dumb. Just be honest and keep it simple: Since I’m only taking on five people, I can give you all the attention you need to get brag-worthy results. And I’ll give it all for free so long as you promise to: 1) Use it 2) Give me feedback and 3) Leave a killer review if you think it deserves one. Does that sound fair?  This sets reasonable expectations upfront. And boom. Now, you’re just helping people for free. Winning.

Imagine that you and your colleague Maria go out to a fancy restaurant thatâ€™s been recommended by Mariaâ€™s friend Ken. The experience is awful. The food stinks, the service is worse. The following day Maria sends Ken an e-mail that says only, â€œAbout the restaurant, it was marvelous, just marvelous.â€ How do you think Ken will interpret the comment? Will he consider the e-mail sincere or sarcastic?

I like to make the free offer physical because it gives me the ability to use the word free, while also requiring the interested customer to pull out their credit card to pay for shipping and qualify as a buyer. If I decide to sell this as a digital product for a small price, then I lose the power of free. And if I just give it away free digitally, then I lose the power of qualifying the buyer when they pay the shipping costs.

Barbara Fredrickson of the University of North Carolina is the leading researcher on positivityâ€”her catchall term for a basket of emotions including amusement, appreciation, joy, interest, gratitude, and inspiration. Negative emotions, she says, evolved to narrow peopleâ€™s vision and propel their behavior toward survival in the moment (Iâ€™m frightened, so Iâ€™ll flee. Iâ€™m angry, so Iâ€™ll fight). By contrast, â€œPositive emotions do the opposite: They broaden peopleâ€™s ideas about possible actions, opening our awareness to a wider range of thoughts andÂ .Â .Â . making us more receptive and more creative,â€ she writes.

Select one or two. Then in the course of the day, look for ways to display those emotions.

Identifying problems as a way to move others takes two long-standing skills and turns them upside down. First, in the past, the best salespeople were adept at accessing information. Today, they must be skilled at curating itâ€”sorting through the massive troves of data and presenting to others the most relevant and clarifying pieces. Second, in the past, the best salespeople were skilled at answering questions (in part because they had information their prospects lacked). Today, they must be good at asking questionsâ€”uncovering possibilities, surfacing latent issues, and finding unexpected problems

The common place people go wrong with developing their USP is they say â€œqualityâ€ or â€œgreat serviceâ€ is their USP. There are two things wrong with that: Quality and great service are expectations, they are just part of good business practiceâ€”not something unique.  People only find out about your quality and great service after theyâ€™ve bought. A good USP is designed to attract prospects before theyâ€™ve made a purchasing decision.

The only time to set a marketing budget is when youâ€™re in the testing phase. In the testing phase I advocate that you fail often and fail cheap until you have a winner. Test your headline, your offer, your ad positioning and other variables. Then cut the losers and optimize the winners until you finally have a combination that gives you the best possible return on investment.

Hereâ€™s the other big reason you want to avoid selling directly from your ad: at any given time (on average) about 3% of your target market are highly motivated and ready to buy immediately. These are the prospects most mass marketing hopes to convert. However, thereâ€™s a further 7% who are very open to buying and another 30% who are interested but not right now. The next 30% are not interested and finally the last 30% wouldnâ€™t even take your product if it was free.

Hvis det at redde fugles liv er et Ã¸konomisk gode, kan man tale om dette gode som en sumlignende variabel: Det burde vÃ¦re meget mere vÃ¦rd at redde 200.000 fugle end 2.000 fugle. Faktisk var den gennemsnitlige donation, som deltagerne i de tre grupper var villige til at betale, henholdsvis 80, 78 og 88 dollars. Antallet af fugle gjorde ikke den store forskel.

Itâ€™s merely stating a preference, saying, â€œIâ€™m interested in having this happen, if I donâ€™t have to do anything.â€ Thatâ€™s not power!

What did I contribute or improve? What did I enjoy? If every day you constantly improve your ability to enjoy your life, then youâ€™ll experience it at a level of richness most people never even dream of.

For example, if youâ€™re feeling depressed and ask yourself, â€œWhat would I have to believe in order to feel depressed?â€ youâ€™ll probably come up with something that relates to the future, like, â€œThings will never get better,â€ or â€œThereâ€™s no hope.â€ When you hear these beliefs verbalized, you might well think, â€œI donâ€™t believe that! I feel bad right now, but I know itâ€™s not going to be bad forever. This, too, shall pass.â€ Or you may just decide that a belief about having problems permanently is totally destructive and one youâ€™re not willing to ever consider again.

Resultatet er krystalklart: 8 procent siger Paul, 92 procent siger George. Dette er besynderligt, fordi de to investorers situationer objektivt set er identiske. De ejer nu begge aktier i virksomhed A, og de ville have haft det samme ekstra belÃ¸b, hvis de ejede aktier i virksomhed B. Den eneste forskel er, at George endte der, hvor han er, ved at handle, mens Paul endte det samme sted ved at undlade at handle.

How do you know which commitment to propose? Put simply, there are two characteristics of the commitments proposed by successful salespeople: 1. The commitment advances the sale. As a result of the commitment, the sale will move forward in some way. 2. The commitment proposed is the highest realistic commitment that the customer is able to give. Successful sellers never push the customer beyond achievable limits.

Before I go into a call, I ask myself, â€œWhat problems can I solve for this customer?â€ The clearer I can be about the problems I can solve, the easier it is to ask effective questions during the discussion.

Before the call, write down at least three potential problems which the buyer may have and which your products or services can solve. Â Â Then write down some examples of actual Problem Questions that you could ask to uncover each of the potential problems youâ€™ve identified.

Even the smartest people weâ€™ve studied find it hard to ask Implication Questions unless theyâ€™ve planned them in advance.

a less bizarre form, calls are often opened with questions like â€œIf I could show you a way to increase productivity here, would you put my company on your bid list?â€ or â€œWould you be interested in a faster way to process your accounts?â€ These are Need-payoff Questions, but asked so early in the call, they are likely to put the customer on the defensive and thus be ineffective.

Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve asked the obvious questionâ€”â€œWhy do you want to do that?â€â€”when one of your customers has requested a capability you donâ€™t offer.

The worst point to ask a Need-payoff Question is when the customer raises a need you canâ€™t meet. Conversely, the best point is when you can meet the need.

In our studies we found that when customers raised needs that the seller could meet, the most likely response from the seller was not to ask Need-payoff Questions but to begin talking about solutions.

There are many generic Need-payoff Questions, such as these:   Why is that important?   How would that help?   Would it be useful if...? Â Â Is there any other way this could help you?

This watch is almost 100 times as expensive as the one in Figure 6.3. Do you think youâ€™d be more likely to buy this expensive watch if there was a list of Features down the side of the advertisement to help persuade you?

Teaching her how to handle objections treats the symptom, but it doesnâ€™t alter the cause. The fundamental selling diseaseâ€”jumping in too soon with solutionsâ€”remains malignant and untreated.

There will always be objections that arise because the customer has needs your product canâ€™t meet or because a competitor has a clear product superiority. These â€œtrueâ€ objections are facts of life, and no objection-prevention technique can do anything to stop them from being raised.

When I was new to selling I thought that, next to closing, objection-handling skills were the ones most crucial to sales success. Looking back, I can now see that my concern was motivated by the large number of objections I was facing from my customers.

studying selling, Iâ€™ve noticed a distinct change. Fifteen years ago buyers would tell me, â€œI buy from Fred because I like him.â€ Now Iâ€™m much more likely to hear, â€œI like Fred, but I buy from his competition because theyâ€™re cheaper.â€ It seems that personal loyalty is no longer an adequate basis for doing business.

When new sales reps visit me for the first time, they usually say, â€˜What a beautiful picture. You must really enjoy sailing.â€™ I reply, â€˜I hate sailing. That pictureâ€™s there to remind me how much time gets wasted out on the water. Now what did you want to see me about?â€™â€

And thereâ€™s another reason. Many buyers become suspicious of people who begin by raising areas of personal interest. They feel that the sellerâ€™s motives arenâ€™t genuine and that itâ€™s an attempt to manipulate them.

Whatâ€™s happened here? By making an opening benefit statement, the seller has been trapped in two ways: Â Â Sheâ€™s been forced to talk about product details too early in the sale, before sheâ€™s had an opportunity to build value by using SPIN questions. Â Â Sheâ€™s allowed the buyer to ask the questions and has therefore allowed him to take control of the discussion.

When Iâ€™m planning Implication Questions, I find itâ€™s useful to imagine a customer whoâ€™s saying â€œSo what? Yes, Iâ€™ve got that problemâ€”but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s serious.â€ I list the arguments Iâ€™d use to convince the customer that the problem really is seriousâ€”itâ€™s causing a loss of efficiency, itâ€™s increasing her costs, and itâ€™s demotivating her better people. Then I turn each of my arguments into a questionâ€”â€œ

People donâ€™t consistently do those simple things for three reasons: 1) while theyâ€™re easy to do, they are also easy not to do; 2) you donâ€™t see any results at first; 3) they seem insignificant, like they donâ€™t matter. But they do.
