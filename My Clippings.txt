Everyone buys bargains. Some people just buy $100,000 things for only $10,000. That’s where we want to live: high prices, but a steal for the value (like hopefully this book so far).

I have always lived by the mantra, “Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction.” This means I generate demand first. Then, with my offer, I get them to say yes. Once I have people saying yes, then, and only then, will I add friction in my marketing, or decide to offer less for the same price.

For the purposes of keeping creativity high (divergent thinking), think about anything you could possibly do. Think of all the things that might enhance the value of your offer. So much so that they would be stupid to say no. What could you do that someone would immediately say, “All that? Seriously? Yes, I'm in.” Doing this exercise will make your job of selling So. Much. Easier.

Easier. Even if you come up with something you’re not actually willing to do, it’s okay. The goal here is to push your limits and jog your brain into thinking of a different version of the solution you’d normally default to. This is where you get to flex your entrepreneurial creativity. Reminder: You only need to do this once. Literally one time for a product that may last years. This is high-value, high-leverage work. You ultimately get paid for thinking. You got this. This should be fun. Go ahead and list out all your possibilities now. Then I’ll take you through my example. I’ll just use the buying food problem from earlier as an example.

But, if I told you I have it set so that every week the page only allows twenty new people to download it, you’d be far more likely to go see if you can grab it. And even more so if when you try it, you see that it has already run out for the week. Result? You join a list that notifies you the next time twenty more checklists become available for download. What happens next? When you get that notification, you’ll hit the link on your phone and go to the page because you don’t want to miss out again. By employing scarcity, we make what would otherwise be a “neat free download” into a desirable thing not everyone has access to. You also, by extension, would be far more likely to consume it when you do get your hands on it . . . all because of how we controlled supply. Cool, right?

The biggest sales on a week long campaign or launch happen in the last 4 hours of the last day (up to 50-60%). That means that the last 3% of the time allotted creates 50-60% of the sales...that’s completely illogical, but also unmistakably human.

Pro Tip: Add Bonuses Instead of Discounting Whenever Possible on Core Offers Whenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness.

The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. Psychologically as you continue to add offers, it continues to expand the price to value discrepancy. It also, subconsciously communicates that the core offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than the bonuses right?

On the maturity continuum, dependence is the paradigm of you—you take care of me; you come through for me; you didn’t come through; I blame you for the results. Independence is the paradigm of I—I can do it; I am responsible; I am self-reliant; I can choose. Interdependence is the paradigm of we—we can do it; we can cooperate; we can combine our talents and abilities and create something greater together. Dependent people need others to get what they want. Independent people can get what they want through their own effort. Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.

There are organizations that talk a lot about the customer and then completely neglect the people that deal with the customer—the employees. The PC principle is to always treat your employees exactly as you want them to treat your best customers. You can buy a person’s hand, but you can’t buy his heart. His heart is where his enthusiasm, his loyalty is. You can buy his back, but you can’t buy his brain. That’s where his creativity is, his ingenuity, his resourcefulness.

The 7 Habits are an Inside-Out Approach, you see. We have to win the Private Victory (Habits 1, 2, and 3) before we can win the Public Victory (Habits 4, 5, and 6). If, for example, you have a bad relationship with your boss, instead of trying to Think Win-Win with her, you first need to examine yourself and identify what you may be doing wrong. Maybe you have bad motives or a hidden agenda. Anytime I have a relationship problem, my experience is that four out of five times, it’s me, not them, and the key to fixing the problem is getting myself right first. It’s inside out. Private Victories always precede Public Victories.

Habit 3: Put First Things Last Procrastinate. Do the urgent things first, like answering every ring, bling, and beep that comes your way. You’ll get to the important stuff later. Don’t worry about strengthening your relationships; they’ll always be there. And why exercise? You still have your health. Just make sure you spend sufficient time each day watching YouTube.

Environmental determinism basically says your boss is doing it to you—or your spouse, or that bratty teenager, or your economic situation, or national policies. Someone or something in your environment is responsible for your situation.

There are actually three social maps—three theories of determinism widely accepted, independently or in combination, to explain the nature of man. Genetic determinism basically says your grandparents did it to you. That’s why you have such a temper. Your grandparents had short tempers and it’s in your DNA. It just goes through the generations and you inherited it. In addition, you’re Irish, and that’s the nature of Irish people. Psychic determinism basically says your parents did it to you. Your upbringing, your childhood experience essentially laid out your personal tendencies and your character structure. That’s why you’re afraid to be in front of a group. It’s the way your parents brought you up. You feel terribly guilty if you make a mistake because you “remember” deep inside the emotional scripting when you were very vulnerable and tender and dependent. You “remember” the emotional punishment, the rejection, the comparison with somebody else when you didn’t perform as well as expected.

Between what happened to him, or the stimulus, and his response to it, was his freedom or power to choose that response. In the midst of his experiences, Frankl would project himself into different circumstances, such as lecturing to his students after his release from the death camps. He would describe himself in the classroom, in his mind’s eye, and give his students the lessons he was learning during his very torture.

In making such a choice, we become reactive. Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn’t, it affects their attitude and their performance.

For those filled with regret, perhaps the most needful exercise of proactivity is to realize that past mistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concern. We can’t recall them, we can’t undo them, we can’t control the consequences that came as a result.

After all that’s been said and written, being proactive comes down to two things. First, take responsibility for your life; and second, take initiative. It’s that simple. Be an agent, not a victim. Don’t wait for life to happen to you; happen to it. Be the driver of your life, not just a passenger. Live out of your imagination, not your past.

My friend Rolfe Kerr has expressed his personal creed in this way: Succeed at home first. Seek and merit divine help. Never compromise with honesty. Remember the people involved. Hear both sides before judging. Obtain counsel of others. Defend those who are absent. Be sincere yet decisive. Develop one new proficiency a year. Plan tomorrow’s work today. Hustle while you wait. Maintain a positive attitude. Keep a sense of humor. Be orderly in person and in work. Do not fear mistakes—fear only the absence of creative, constructive, and corrective responses to those mistakes. Facilitate the success of subordinates. Listen twice as much as you speak. Concentrate all abilities and efforts on the task at hand, not worrying about the next job or promotion.

If our sense of emotional worth comes primarily from our marriage, then we become highly dependent upon that relationship. We become vulnerable to the moods and feelings, the behavior and treatment of our spouse, or to any external event that may impinge on the relationship—a new child, in-laws, economic setbacks, social successes, and so forth.

Sometimes there are apparently noble reasons given for making money, such as the desire to take care of one’s family. And these things are important. But to focus on moneymaking as a center will bring about its own undoing.

Too many vacations that last too long, too many movies, too much TV, too much video game playing—too much undisciplined leisure time in which a person continually takes the course of least resistance gradually wastes a life. It ensures that a person’s capacities stay dormant, that talents remain undeveloped, that the mind and spirit become lethargic, and that the heart is unfulfilled.

Many “older” children go through life either secretly or openly hating their parents. They blame them for past abuses, neglect, or favoritism and they center their adult life on that hatred, living out the reactive, justifying script that accompanies it.

Perhaps the most common center today is the self. The most obvious form is selfishness, which violates the values of most people. But if we look closely at many of the popular approaches to growth and self-fulfillment, we often find self-centering at their core.

As a person fluctuates from one center to another, the resulting relativism is like roller coasting through life. One moment you’re high, the next moment you’re low, making efforts to compensate for one weakness by borrowing strength from another weakness. There is no consistent sense of direction, no persistent wisdom, no steady power supply or sense of personal, intrinsic worth and identity.

Third, what you choose to do contributes to your ultimate values in life. Staying at work to get the edge on someone at the office is an entirely different evening in your life from staying because you value your boss’s effectiveness and you genuinely want to contribute to the company’s welfare.

I can use my right brain power of visualization to write an “affirmation” that will help me become more congruent with my deeper values in my daily life. A good affirmation has five basic ingredients: it’s personal, it’s positive, it’s present tense, it’s visual, and it’s emotional. So I might write something like this: “It is deeply satisfying (emotional) that I (personal) respond (present tense) with wisdom, love, firmness, and self-control (positive) when my children misbehave.” Then I can visualize it. I can spend a few minutes each day and totally relax my mind and body. I can think about situations in which my children might misbehave. I can visualize them in rich detail. I can feel the texture of the chair I might be sitting on, the floor under my feet, the sweater I’m wearing. I can see the dress my daughter has on, the expression on her face. The more clearly and vividly I can imagine the detail, the more deeply I will experience it, the less I will see it as a spectator.

You can do it in every area of your life. Before a performance, a sales presentation, a difficult confrontation, or the daily challenge of meeting a goal, see it clearly, vividly, relentlessly, over and over again. Create an internal “comfort zone.” Then, when you get into the situation, it isn’t foreign. It doesn’t scare you.

Roles and goals give structure and organized direction to your personal mission. If you don’t yet have a personal mission statement, it’s a good place to begin. Just identifying the various areas of your life and the two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each area to move ahead gives you an overall perspective of your life and a sense of direction.

Example: Imagine we help homeowners sell their homes. That is a broad solution. But what about the steps before selling a home? Owners want to know what their house is worth. They want to know how to increase its value. They need pictures. They need it cleaned. They need landscaping. They need minor things fixed. They need moving services. They may need staging. Etc. These are all narrow problems–great for lead magnets. We pick one of the narrow problems and solve it for free. And although it helps, it makes their other problem more obvious–they still have to sell their home. But now we’ve earned their trust. So we can charge to solve the remaining problems with our core offer and help them achieve their broader goal.

After people show interest, make your offer easy to say yes to. I like to start with the easiest offer enhancer in the world - FREE: And don’t try to look advanced if you’re not. People aren’t dumb. Just be honest and keep it simple: Since I’m only taking on five people, I can give you all the attention you need to get brag-worthy results. And I’ll give it all for free so long as you promise to: 1) Use it 2) Give me feedback and 3) Leave a killer review if you think it deserves one. Does that sound fair?  This sets reasonable expectations upfront. And boom. Now, you’re just helping people for free. Winning.

Will he consider the e-mail sincere or sarcastic?

I like to make the free offer physical because it gives me the ability to use the word free, while also requiring the interested customer to pull out their credit card to pay for shipping and qualify as a buyer. If I decide to sell this as a digital product for a small price, then I lose the power of free. And if I just give it away free digitally, then I lose the power of qualifying the buyer when they pay the shipping costs.

Barbara Fredrickson of the University of North Carolina is the leading researcher on positivityâ€”her catchall term for a basket of emotions including amusement, appreciation, joy, interest, gratitude, and inspiration. Negative emotions, she says, evolved to narrow peopleâ€™s vision and propel their behavior toward survival in the moment (Iâ€™m frightened, so Iâ€™ll flee. Iâ€™m angry, so Iâ€™ll fight). By contrast, â€œPositive emotions do the opposite: They broaden peopleâ€™s ideas about possible actions, opening our awareness to a wider range of thoughts andÂ .Â .Â . making us more receptive and more creative,â€ she writes.

Select one or two. Then in the course of the day, look for ways to display those emotions.

Identifying problems as a way to move others takes two long-standing skills and turns them upside down. First, in the past, the best salespeople were adept at accessing information. Today, they must be skilled at curating itâ€”sorting through the massive troves of data and presenting to others the most relevant and clarifying pieces. Second, in the past, the best salespeople were skilled at answering questions (in part because they had information their prospects lacked).

The common place people go wrong with developing their USP is they say â€œqualityâ€ or â€œgreat serviceâ€ is their USP. There are two things wrong with that: Quality and great service are expectations, they are just part of good business practiceâ€”not something unique.  People only find out about your quality and great service after theyâ€™ve bought. A good USP is designed to attract prospects before theyâ€™ve made a purchasing decision.

The only time to set a marketing budget is when youâ€™re in the testing phase. In the testing phase I advocate that you fail often and fail cheap until you have a winner. Test your headline, your offer, your ad positioning and other variables. Then cut the losers and optimize the winners until you finally have a combination that gives you the best possible return on investment.

Hereâ€™s the other big reason you want to avoid selling directly from your ad: at any given time (on average) about 3% of your target market are highly motivated and ready to buy immediately. These are the prospects most mass marketing hopes to convert. However, thereâ€™s a further 7% who are very open to buying and another 30% who are interested but not right now. The next 30% are not interested and finally the last 30% wouldnâ€™t even take your product if it was free.

For example, if youâ€™re feeling depressed and ask yourself, â€œWhat would I have to believe in order to feel depressed?â€ youâ€™ll probably come up with something that relates to the future, like, â€œThings will never get better,â€ or â€œThereâ€™s no hope.â€ When you hear these beliefs verbalized, you might well think, â€œI donâ€™t believe that! I feel bad right now, but I know itâ€™s not going to be bad forever. This, too, shall pass.â€ Or you may just decide that a belief about having problems permanently is totally destructive and one youâ€™re not willing to ever consider again.

Â»Vi bÃ¸r ikke kun fokusere pÃ¥ et enkelt scenarie, for sÃ¥ risikerer vi at overdrive sandsynligheden for det. Lad os opstille specifikke alternativer og sikre os, at de samlede sandsynligheder giver 100 procent.Â«

Resultatet er krystalklart: 8 procent siger Paul, 92 procent siger George. Dette er besynderligt, fordi de to investorers situationer objektivt set er identiske. De ejer nu begge aktier i virksomhed A, og de ville have haft det samme ekstra belÃ¸b, hvis de ejede aktier i virksomhed B. Den eneste forskel er, at George endte der, hvor han er, ved at handle, mens Paul endte det samme sted ved at undlade at handle.

ForÃ¦ldrene blev bedt om at nÃ¦vne den rabat, der ville fÃ¥ dem til at skifte til det billigere (og mindre sikre) produkt. Mere end to tredjedele af forÃ¦ldre i undersÃ¸gelsen svarede, at de under ingen omstÃ¦ndigheder ville kÃ¸be det nye produkt! De var Ã¸jensynligt oprÃ¸rte over selve tanken om at veksle deres barns sikkerhed til penge. Det mindretal, der fandt frem til en rabat, de kunne acceptere, krÃ¦vede et belÃ¸b, der var betydeligt hÃ¸jere end det belÃ¸b, de var villige til at betale for en langt stÃ¸rre forbedring af produktets sikkerhed.

Fotografen ser ikke sceneriet som et Ã¸jeblik, der skal nydes, men som en fremtidig erindring, der skal designes. Billeder kan vÃ¦re nyttige for det erindrende selv â€“ selv om vi sjÃ¦ldent ser pÃ¥ dem sÃ¦rligt lÃ¦nge eller sÃ¥ ofte, som vi forventede, hvis overhovedet â€“ men det at tage billeder er ikke nÃ¸dvendigvis den bedste mÃ¥de for turistens oplevende selv at nyde udsigten pÃ¥. I mange tilfÃ¦lde bedÃ¸mmer vi ferier pÃ¥ baggrund af den historie og de minder, som vi forventer at lagre. Ordet â€˜mindevÃ¦rdigâ€™ bruges alt for ofte til at beskrive hÃ¸jdepunkter under ferien, hvorved mÃ¥let for oplevelsen eksplicit kommer for dagens lys.

However, his status at Cambridge was represented differently in each of the classes. To one class, he was presented as a student; to a second class, a demonstrator; to another, a lecturer; to yet another, a senior lecturer; to a fifth, a professor. After he left the room, each class was asked to estimate his height. It was found that with each increase in status, the same man grew in perceived height by an average of a half inch, so that as the â€œprofessorâ€ he was seen as two and a half inches taller than as the â€œstudent.â€94

How do you know which commitment to propose? Put simply, there are two characteristics of the commitments proposed by successful salespeople: 1. The commitment advances the sale. As a result of the commitment, the sale will move forward in some way. 2. The commitment proposed is the highest realistic commitment that the customer is able to give. Successful sellers never push the customer beyond achievable limits.

Â Â Sheâ€™s allowed the buyer to ask the questions and has therefore allowed him to take control of the discussion.

What happens if you add one small, simple, positive action to the success side? Nothing you can see. What happens if you add one more? Nothing you can see. What happens if you keep adding one more, and one more, and one more, and one more â€¦ Before too long, you see the scales shift, ever so slightly. And then again. And eventually, that heavy â€œfailureâ€ side starts to lift, and lift, and lift â€¦ and the scales start swinging your way. No matter how much negative weight from the past is on the other side, just by adding those little grams of success, one at a time (and by not adding more weight to the failure side), you will eventually and inevitably begin to shift the scales in your favor.

When you donâ€™t take responsibility, when you blame others, circumstances, fate, or chance, you give away your power.

The long list is a detailed accounting of whatâ€™s wrong with their spouse, and the short list is a summary of whatâ€™s right. The long list they consult every day. And the short list? Thatâ€™s the one they read at the funeral.

What about the other direction? I said there were two ways that tension can resolve, and the second way is the one that works against you. If you donâ€™t close the gap by moving your present circumstance (A) constantly toward your goals and dreams (B), how else can you let the tension resolve? Quit dreaming. Just let go of all your dreams, goals, ambitions, and aspirations. Settle for less. Make point B disappear, just delete it, andâ€”poof!â€”the tension is gone. And that, sadly, is the choice that the 95 percent who travel the failure curve eventually make.

How many times do we pay for one mistake? The answer is thousands of times. The human is the only animal on earth that pays a thousand times for the same mistake. The rest of the animals pay once for every mistake they make. But not us. We have a powerful memory. We make a mistake, we judge ourselves, we find ourselves guilty, and we punish ourselves. If justice exists, then that was enough; we donâ€™t need to do it again. But every time we remember, we judge ourselves again, we are guilty again, and we punish ourselves again, and again, and again. If we have a wife or husband he or she also reminds us of the mistake, so we can judge ourselves again, punish ourselves again, and find ourselves guilty again. Is this fair?

Some years ago one man in Germany, by the use of the word, manipulated a whole country of the most intelligent people. He led them into a world war with just the power of his word. He convinced others to commit the most atrocious acts of violence. He activated peopleâ€™s fear with the word, and like a big explosion, there was killing and war all around the world. All over the world humans destroyed other humans because they were afraid of each other.

Someone gives an opinion and says, â€œLook, this girl is ugly!â€ The girl listens, believes she is ugly, and grows up with the idea that she is ugly. It doesnâ€™t matter how beautiful she is; as long as she has that agreement, she will believe that she is ugly.

it was not that the little girlâ€™s voice was ugly. But the daughter believed what her mother said, and in that moment she made an agreement with herself. After that she no longer sang, because she believed her voice was ugly and would bother anyone who heard it. She became shy at school, and if she was asked to sing, she refused. Even speaking to others became difficult for her. Everything changed in the little girl because of this new agreement: She believed she must repress her emotions in order to be accepted and loved. Whenever we hear an opinion and believe it, we make an agreement, and it becomes part of our belief system. This little girl grew up, and even though she had a beautiful voice, she never sang again. She developed a whole complex from one spell. This spell was cast upon her by the one who loved her the most: her own mother. Her mother didnâ€™t notice what she did with her word. She didnâ€™t notice that she used black magic and put a spell on her daughter. She didnâ€™t know the power of her word, and therefore she isnâ€™t to blame. She did what her own mother, father, and others had done

In order to seek revenge you said something to or about that person with the intention of spreading poison and making that person feel bad about him- or herself.

The only way to multiply your business results without multiplying the time and resources you put in is with leverageâ€”a recurring theme of this book. Linear thinking gives you incremental gains. Leveraged thinking gets you exponential results. So, what is leverage, exactly? Leverage is anything that multiplies the force of your inputs. If you can put one unit of time, money, or energy in and get more than one unit back out, thatâ€™s leverage at work. Leverage is a force multiplier.

Problem aware: Someone who has a problem but doesnâ€™t know there are solutions to that problem. Solution aware: Someone who knows there are solutions but hasnâ€™t chosen one and doesnâ€™t know about your solution or product. Product aware: Someone who knows about your solution or product but isnâ€™t sure it solves their problem or hasnâ€™t selected you from your competitors. Most aware: Someone who knows a lot about your solution or product. Theyâ€™re on the cusp of buying but need to know the specifics.

Dharmesh Shah, the billionaire founder of HubSpot, described it as the Venn diagram of success. It goes something like this: Imagine a giant whiteboard with a dot representing each human on Earth. Thereâ€™d be about 8 billion dots on this whiteboard. We draw a circle around all the people who are good at writing. Letâ€™s be generous and say itâ€™s 10 percent. So 800 million people. Thatâ€™s a lot of competition. Then, we draw another circle around all the people with strong business knowledge. Again, being generous, letâ€™s say itâ€™s 1 percent. We draw a third circle around all the people who understand systems, technology, and software tools at a deep level. Letâ€™s say 5 percent. Finally, we draw a circle around all the people willing to undergo the unreasonable difficulty and pain involved in writing and publishing a nonfiction book. At most, this would be 0.05 percent of the population. The number of dots inside the intersection of these four circles would be incredibly small. My guess is that it may be a total of 100 dots. So, my worldwide â€œcompetitionâ€ is about 100 other authors in my space. I personally know about 30 of them, and we donâ€™t consider ourselves competitors because multiple people can win this game. In fact, we frequently share ideas and promote each otherâ€™s books.

Pass your short-form message through each of these seven filters to ensure itâ€™s magnetic. Once youâ€™ve drafted your message, ask yourself: Is it about them? Is it easy to understand? Is it believable? Is it interesting or unique? Is it the good thing without the bad thing? Is it clear who itâ€™s for? Is the next action clear?

If you keep this agreement, you can travel around the world with your heart completely open and no one can hurt you. You can say, â€œI love you,â€ without fear of being ridiculed or rejected. You can ask for what you need. You can say yes, or you can say no â€” whatever you choose â€” without guilt or self-judgment. You can choose to follow your heart always. Then you can be in the middle of hell and still experience inner peace and happiness. You can stay in your state of bliss, and hell will not affect you at all.

If we see a child who is two or three, perhaps four years old, we find a free human. Why is this human free? Because this human does whatever he or she wants to do. The human is completely wild. Just like a flower, a tree, or an animal that has not been domesticated â€” wild! And if we observe humans who are two years old, we find that most of the time these humans have a big smile on their face and theyâ€™re having fun. They are exploring the world. They are not afraid to play. They are afraid when they are hurt, when they are hungry, when some of their needs are not met, but they donâ€™t worry about the past, donâ€™t care about the future, and only live in the present moment. Very young children are not afraid to express what they feel. They are so loving that if they perceive love, they melt into love. They are not afraid to love at all. That is the description of a normal human being. As children we are not afraid of the future or ashamed of the past.

I had to leave my shoes unlaced in order to make them fit my swollen feet. There would not have been space for socks even if I had had any. So my partly bare feet were always wet and my shoes always full of snow. This, of course, caused frostbite and chilblains. Every single step became real torture.

One evening, when we were already resting on the floor of our hut, dead tired, soup bowls in hand, a fellow prisoner rushed in and asked us to run out to the assembly grounds and see the wonderful sunset. Standing outside we saw sinister clouds glowing in the west and the whole sky alive with clouds of ever-changing shapes and colors, from steel blue to blood red. The desolate grey mud huts provided a sharp contrast, while the puddles on the muddy ground reflected the glowing sky. Then, after minutes of moving silence, one prisoner said to another, â€œHow beautiful the world could be!â€

If an air raid alarm had not interrupted us after two hours (during which time the foreman had worked on me especially), making it necessary to regroup the workers afterwards, I think that I would have returned to camp on one of the sledges which carried those who had died or were dying from exhaustion.

So I began by mentioning the most trivial of comforts first. I said that even in this Europe in the sixth winter of the Second World War, our situation was not the most terrible we could think of. I said that each of us had to ask himself what irreplaceable losses he had suffered up to then. I speculated that for most of them these losses had really been few. Whoever was still alive had reason for hope. Health, family, happiness, professional abilities, fortune, position in society â€”all these were things that could be achieved again or restored. After all, we still had all our bones intact. Whatever we had gone through could still be an asset to us in the future. And I quoted from Nietzsche: â€œWas mich nicht umbringt, macht mich stÃ¤rker.â€ (That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.) Then I spoke about the future. I said that to the impartial the future must seem hopeless. I agreed that each of us could guess for himself how small were his chances of survival. I told them that although there was still no typhus epidemic in the camp, I estimated my own chances at about one in twenty. But I also told them that, in spite of this, I had no intention of losing hope and giving up. For no man knew what the future would bring, much less the next hour. Even if we could not expect any sensational military events in the next few days, who knew better than we, with our experience of camps, how great chances sometimes opened up, quite suddenly, at least for the individual. For instance, one might be attached unexpectedly to a special group with exceptionally good working conditionsâ€”for this was the kind of thing which constituted the â€œluckâ€ of the prisoner. But I did not only talk of the future and the veil which was drawn over it. I also mentioned the past; all its joys, and how its light shone even in the present darkness. Again I quoted a poetâ€”to avoid sounding like a preacher myselfâ€”who had written, â€œWas Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben.â€ (What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.) Not only our experiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have had, and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have brought it into being. Having been is also a kind of being, and perhaps the surest kind. Then I spoke of the many opportunities of giving life a meaning. I told my comrades (who lay motionless, although occasionally a sigh could be heard) that human life, under any circumstances, never ceases to have a meaning, and that this infinite meaning of life includes suffering and dying, privation and death. I asked the poor creatures who listened to me attentively in the darkness of the hut to face up to the seriousness of our position. They must not lose hope but should keep their courage in the certainty that the hopelessness of our struggle did not detract from its dignity and its meaning. I said that someone looks down on each of us in diffcult hoursâ€”a friend, a wife, somebody alive or dead, or a Godâ€”and he would not expect us to disappoint him. He would hope to find us suffering proudlyâ€”not miserablyâ€”knowing how to die. And finally I spoke of our sacrifice, which had meaning in every case. It was in the nature of this sacrifice that it should appear to be pointless in the normal world, the world of material success. But in reality our sacrifice did have a meaning. Those of us who had any religious faith, I said frankly, could understand without diffculty. I told them of a comrade who on his arrival in camp had tried to make a pact with Heaven that his suffering and death should save the human being he loved from a painful end. For this man, suffering and death were meaningful; his was a sacrifice of the deepest significance. He did not want to die for nothing. None of us wanted that.

From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these twoâ€”the â€œraceâ€ of the decent man and the â€œraceâ€ of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere; they penetrate into all groups of society. No group consists entirely of decent or indecent people. In this sense, no group is of â€œpure raceâ€â€”and therefore one occasionally found a decent fellow among the camp guards.

Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.

â€œWhat would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?â€ â€œOh,â€ he said, â€œfor her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!â€ Whereupon I replied, â€œYou see, Doc- tor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this sufferingâ€”to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.â€ He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my offce. In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.

The question was whether an ape which was being used to develop poliomyelitis serum, and for this reason punctured again and again, would ever be able to grasp the meaning of its suffering. Unanimously, the group replied that of course it would not; with its limited intelligence, it could not enter into the world of man, i.e., the only world in which the meaning of its suffering would be understandable. Then I pushed forward with the following question: â€œAnd what about man? Are you sure that the human world is a terminal point in the evolution of the cosmos? Is it not conceivable that there is still another dimension, a world beyond manâ€™s world; a world in which the question of an ultimate meaning of human suffering would find an answer?â€

I made a last attempt to help him by inquiring whether he did not hope to see his children again in Heaven. However, my question was followed by an outburst of tears, and now the true reason for his despair came to the fore: he explained that his children, since they died as innocent martyrs,7 were thus found worthy of the highest place in Heaven, but as for himself he could not expect, as an old, sinful man, to be assigned the same place.

â€™Habitloopâ€™, et begreb som New York Times-journalisten, Charles Duhigg, gjorde populÃ¦rt i sin bestseller: The Power Of Habit. Habitloopet er den proces, som enhver vane gennemlÃ¸ber, og det bestÃ¥r af tre elementer â€“ 1) Et stikord, 2) En rutine og 3) En belÃ¸nning. FÃ¸rst kommer stikordet, der fortÃ¦ller din hjerne, at det er tid til at sÃ¦tte gang i en vane. DernÃ¦st kommer selve rutinen, hvor du udfÃ¸rer vanen. Og til sidst kommer belÃ¸nningen, som husker din hjerne pÃ¥, at denne vane er vÃ¦rd at fastholde og gennemfÃ¸re igen.
